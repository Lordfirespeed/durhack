        ],

            "If you want to learn to code but don't know where to start, you should definitely \n\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/on-coding/you-can-already-code-you-just-dont-know-it-yet-862044601a5a\" target=\"_blank\">read this blogpost</a>\n\n.",

            "However, if you are already looking for teammates, we'd recommend teams to have roughly 4 people in them, but a maximum of 5 people is allowed per team. Remember that, of course, each member of your team needs to have their own DurHack ticket."
